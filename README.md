# label_image
This repository contains:  
1 A software to label image  
2 APIs convert detection data to other formats(VOC,COCO,YOLO) 

## Label Image Software
The img_label_boxed.exe is for Windows7, no library installation requirements.
This tool can be used for making classification, tracking, and detection Datasets.

### Classification
After type the username and password, click Classification button

Click Open Dir Button to select a image

Choose a checkbox,and click classify button. You can also go to any frame with the GO button on the upright corner.

The classied images will be copied to corresponding folders.

### Tracking
Click Tracking Button, and draw bounding box by mouse, the coordinates of bounding box will be shown in the bottom.

Click track button, then go to next image. The results will be saved in the results.txt  
`The format is : image_name x/width y/height w/width h/height`

### Detection
Click Detection Button, draw bouding box of one object, then choose a checkbox and click detect object button. After drawn all objects in this frame, click detect image button and go to next image.

The results will be saved in Detection/image_name.txt.   
`The format is : label x/width y/height w/width h/height`

## APIs for Detection
Different detection platforms require different formats of data.So it is impossible to use our detection dataset from the tool directly.I will provide APIs to convert our format to popular detection formats easily. Right now, it only surport VOC, COCO, YOLO. I will consider to add tensorflows' format and Mxnets'format.

### Library Dependencies
opencv3  
lxml  
xml

### Usage
python main.py  
--detected_dir       "/home/Detection"  
--image_path         "/home/Images"  
--saved_dir         "/home/VOC2007"  
--train_percent      0.9  
--convert_to         voc
 
detected_dir: the path of detection data made from this tool  
image_path : the path of original images  
saved_dir : the directory you want to save the converted data  
train_percent : how many percent of image you want to train  
convert_to: which format you want to convert to (choose one from "voc","yolo", "coco")
